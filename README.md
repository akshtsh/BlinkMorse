# BlinkMorse
BlinkMorse is a browser-based Morse code translator that uses your eyes as the controller. It leverages computer vision to detect eye blinks in real-time, interpreting them as dots and dashes to translate Morse code into English text—all wrapped in a nostalgic 80s retro-arcade interface.
